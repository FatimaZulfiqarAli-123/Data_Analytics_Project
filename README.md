# 🚢 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns that influenced passenger survival.
The goal is to clean the data, handle missing values, analyze distributions, and visualize relationships between features using Python.

## 🔎 Steps Performed

### 1. Data Cleaning

* Filled missing Age values with median
* Filled Embarked with mode
* Dropped Cabin column
* Removed unnecessary data

### 2. Exploratory Analysis

* Age distribution (Histogram)
* Survival count (Bar chart)
* Survival by Gender
* Survival by Passenger Class
* Correlation heatmap

### 3. Visualization

Used:

* Histograms
* Countplots
* Boxplots
* Heatmaps

---

## 📊 Key Insights

* Females had a higher survival rate than males
* First-class passengers survived more than others
* Higher fare passengers had better survival chances
* Age had moderate impact on survival
